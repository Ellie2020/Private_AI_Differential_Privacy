1.Creation of a virtual enviroment pysyft and installation of main libraries in conda: Python3.6, Torch 1.0.1, Numpy

2.Jupyter notebook input database (db) contains 5000 entries (e.g. hypotetically each entry could represent a client)
Creation of a function able to generate parallel databases from an input database. 
Each parallel database contains all the entries from db minus one entry (4999 entries each). 
The aim is to use the function generating a list of databases (5000 parallel different databases, each one having 4999 entries)
